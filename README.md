## Hey, I'm Elliot 👋🏼

Welcome to my personal playground for halfway building applications, experimenting with new tech, and starting projects where I immediately have the need to google what the `this` key-word means in JS.
In the day, I'm a software engineer building telehealth solutions with React, but at night I lay around and procrastinate on my personal projects.
